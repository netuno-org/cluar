CLUAR CMS facilitates the creation of websites using ReactJS but with the maintenance of content, navigation, pages, languages, settings and much more, through a back office provided by the Neptune platform.

For those who are starting to learn about ReactJS & CSS, you will be able to create a modern and customized website in a very practical and intuitive way.

For those who already master ReactJS & CSS, you will be able to greatly reduce the implementation time of dynamic websites with content management, so you can focus more on design and advanced customizations.

1. [Page](page/README.md)

6. [Action](action/README.md)
7. [Dictionary](dictionary/README.md)
8. [Settings](configuration/README.md)
9. [Funcionalidade](functionality/README.md)
